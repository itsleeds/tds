# Seminar 2: Will Deakin

## Make Things as Simple as Possible...but no Simpler

The slides and high-resolution versions of some images from [the talk are available here](https://github.com/anisotropi4/shambles/tree/main/tds)

## The Global Railway

The railway is international, noting the location of the United Kingdom

## The British Railway

The operation of railway infrastructure in Britain is organised into thirteen routes and six regions.

This diagram show four routes that make up the Eastern region.

# Logical Models

To understand the a complex system like the railway it helps to decompose the system into a set of logical processes.


## Logical Network Model

The timetable production process can be modeled as a series of processes and interactions between railway operators and infrastructure manager.

## Logical Operations Model

The operation production process can be modeled as series of processes and data exchange.

# Emissions

Why does rail matter

![](images/carbon.jpg){width=720}

Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to UK, Europe and the world

- We need rail modal shift to rail freight transport to delivery
- no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050
- economic growth decoupled from resource use
- where no person and no place left behind

(From the European Rail Green Deal 2019)

## Green House Gases (CO~2~)

UK produced 455 million tonnes CO~2~ equivalent (mtCO2e) in 2019


Transport accounted for 122 mtCO2e (26.8%) of which


- HGV 19.5 mtCO2e (16.0%/4.2%)
- All rail 1.7 mtCO2e (1.4%/0.04%)
- A freight train removes up to 76 HGVs from our roads
