## Use of GenAI

**Generative AI Category: AMBER**  
Under this category, AI tools can be used in an assistive role.  

In this assessment, AI tools can be utilised in an assistive role to:  
- Act as a support tutor, assisting your research on the topic (e.g., asking clarifying questions or suggesting areas to investigate).  
- Test and debug any code you produce yourself as part of the assignment.  
- Provide ideas or inspiration to help you overcome a creative block.  
- Give feedback on content or proofread content that you have generated yourself.  

In this assessment, AI tools **cannot** be utilised to:  
- Produce the entirety of, or sections of, a piece of work that you submit for assessment beyond that which is outlined above.  

The use of Generative AI must be acknowledged in an **‘Acknowledgements’** section of any piece of academic work where it has been used as a functional tool to assist in the process of creating academic work. The minimum requirement to include in acknowledgement:  
- Name and version of the generative AI system used (e.g., ChatGPT-4.0).  
- Publisher (company that made the AI system) (e.g., OpenAI).  
- URL of the AI system.  
- Brief description (single sentence) of the context in which the tool was used.  

**Example:**  
“I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT-3.5 (Open AI, https://chat.openai.com/) to summarise my initial notes and to proofread my final draft.”  

The standard Academic Misconduct procedure applies for students believed to have ignored this categorisation.  
For detailed guidance, see [Generative AI and Assessments](https://generative-ai.leeds.ac.uk/ai-and-assessments/categories-of-assessments/).

## Assessment Criteria and Process

### Submission Requirements

You will submit a `.zip` file containing:

1. A **concise PDF document** (recommended length: 2 pages, absolute maximum: 5 pages) outlining:
   - A draft title of your topic.
   - The main dataset you will use and other potential datasets.
   - Ideas on a research question.
   - Questions you would like to ask about the topic (e.g., "Is this a suitable dataset?").
   - At least **2 references** to academic literature related to the topic.
   - Minimal code and/or a description of where you accessed the data and how you imported it.
   - Any preliminary analysis you have done.
   - A suggested structure for the document:
     - Topics considered.
     - Input datasets.
     - Analysis plan (e.g., a workflow diagram as shown [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/127524923-7d9f5511-84a6-430b-8de9-a603a5524f39.png)).
     - Motivation for choosing this topic.
     - Questions and options.
2. **Reproducible code** in a `.qmd` file.

### Purpose of the Submission

- To allow you to ask questions to the course team (e.g., "Does this sound like a reasonable input dataset and topic?").
- To describe progress on reading input datasets and the analysis plan.
- To receive feedback on your approach before the final submission.

### Rendering Instructions

- If you cannot render to PDF directly, render to HTML and convert to PDF by printing to PDF from your browser.

## Presentation/Formatting and Referencing

You must appropriately cite all supporting evidence using appropriate references and a consistent, professional style.

See [the authoring tutorial with RStudio at quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html#citations) for guidance on how to add citations to your document in RStudio's Visual Editor mode.

## Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism

The university expects that all the work you do, which includes all forms of assessments submitted and examinations taken, meet the university’s standard for Academic Integrity. All forms of Academic Integrity are investigated through the Academic Misconduct Procedure. This applies to all taught elements of your study, including undergraduate programmes, taught postgraduate study, and taught elements of research degrees. Breaching academic integrity standards can lead to serious penalties.  

Guidance on Academic Integrity and Academic Misconduct can be found on the [For Students website pages](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10110/academic-integrity). Full definitions of offences under the Academic Misconduct Procedure can be found in the [Academic Misconduct Procedure](https://secretariat.leeds.ac.uk/student-cases/academic-misconduct/).
