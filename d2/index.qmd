This is a formative (non-assessed but required) submission that will help you develop your final coursework. The deadline is **28th February 2025, 13:59**.

## What to Submit

Submit a `.zip` file containing two key items:

1. A **concise PDF document** (recommended length: 2 pages, absolute maximum: 5 pages) outlining:
    - Your chosen transport-related topic
    - The main dataset(s) you plan to use
    - Your research question
    - At least 2 academic references (see [Quarto Citation Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html#citations) for details)
    - Any initial analysis or questions you have

2. **Reproducible code** as a `.qmd` file showing how you accessed and processed your data

## Template and example submission

See the [template.qmd](https://github.com/itsleeds/tds/blob/main/d2/template.qmd) file (and [rendered result](template)) for guidance on the structure of your submission. An example submission is available [in the d2/example.qmd file](https://github.com/itsleeds/tds/blob/main/d2/example.qmd) (rendered [here](example)).

See the source code of these files, including the .bib files for creating references, in the course repository: [github.com/itsleeds/tds/tree/main/d2](https://github.com/itsleeds/tds/tree/main/d2).

## Key Requirements

- Maximum .zip file size: 30 MB
- Submit via Turnitin
- AI tools can be used in an assistive role (must be acknowledged)
- Use the default quarto referencing style

## Topics and Datasets

Some suggested areas include:

- Road safety analysis
- Infrastructure and travel behavior
- Traffic congestion patterns
- Public transport accessibility
- Active travel infrastructure
- Transport equity studies
- Other transport-related topics are encouraged

Specific examples could include:

- What is the relationship between travel behaviour (e.g. as manifested in origin-destination data represented as desire lines, routes and route networks) and road traffic casualties in a transport region (e.g. London, West Midlands and other regions in the `pct::pct_regions$region_name` data)

- Analysis of a large transport dataset, e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201889

- Infrastructure and travel behaviour
  - What are the relationships between specific types of infrastructure and travel, e.g. between fast roads and walking?
  - How do official sources of infrastructure data (e.g. the [CID](https://github.com/PublicHealthDataGeek/CycleInfraLnd/)) compare with crowd-sourced datasets such as OpenStreetMap (which can be accessed with the new [`osmextract` R package](https://github.com/ropensci/osmextract))
  - Using new data sources to support transport planning, e.g. using data from https://telraam.net/ or https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/high-resolution-population-density-maps 

- Changing transport systems
  - Modelling change in transport systems, e.g. by comparing before/after data for different countries/cities, which countries had the hardest lockdowns and where have changes been longer term? - see here for open data: https://github.com/ActiveConclusion/COVID19_mobility
  - How have movement patterns changed during the Coronavirus pandemic and what impact is that likely to have long term (see [here](https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/articles/report3.html) for some graphics on this)
  
- Software / web development
  - Creating a package to make a particular data source more accessible, see https://github.com/ropensci/stats19 and https://github.com/elipousson/crashapi examples
  - Development of a data dashboard, e.g. using [Quarto Dashboards](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/)
  - Development of a web app, e.g. using the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package
  
- Road safety - how can we makes roads and transport systems in general safer?
  - Influence of Road Infrastructure: 
    - Assessing the role of well-designed pedestrian crossings, roundabouts, and traffic calming measures in preventing road accidents. 
    - Investigating the correlation between road surface quality (e.g., potholes, uneven surfaces) and the frequency of accidents.
  - Influence of Traffic Management: 
    - Assessing the role of traffic lights and speed cameras in preventing road accidents. 
    - Investigating the correlation between the frequency of accidents and the presence of traffic calming measures (e.g., speed bumps, chicanes, road narrowing, etc.).
  - Legislation and Enforcement:
    - 1. Assessing the role of speed limits in preventing road accidents.

- Traffic congestion - how can we reduce congestion?
  - Data Collection and Analysis:
    - Utilizing real-time traffic data from platforms like Waze and Google Maps to forecast congestion patterns.
    - Analyzing historical traffic data to identify recurring congestion patterns and anticipate future traffic bottlenecks.
  - Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling:
    - Designing machine learning models that use past and current traffic data to predict future congestion levels.
