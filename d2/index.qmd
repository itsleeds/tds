- Deadline for non-assessed submission of a .zip file containing a short (5 page max) pdf document with ideas explaining your thoughts on your topic and a plan for completing the coursework by the deadline.


 The document will allow you to ask questions to people on the course team (e.g. "does this sound like a reasonable input dataset and topic?") and describe progress on reading in input datasets and the analysis plan.
 
 The document should be written in a .qmd file and should contain:
  - A draft title of your topic
  - The main dataset that you will use and other datasets that you could use
  - Ideas on a research question
  - Questions you would like to ask about the topic, e.g. 'is this a suitable dataset?'
  - 2 or more references to the academic literature related to the topic
  - Minimal code and/or description of where you accessed the data and how you imported it
  - Any preliminary analysis you have done
  - The structure of the document could include
    - Topics considered
    - Input datasets
    - Analysis plan - I suggest creating a workflow diagram for this, e.g. as presented [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/127524923-7d9f5511-84a6-430b-8de9-a603a5524f39.png)
    - Motivation for choosing this topic
    - Questions and options 


You will submit a .zip file containing the reproducible code (in a .qmd file for most people unless you have a good reason for using another format) and the resulting PDF.
If you cannot render to PDF directly you can render to HTML and convert to PDF by printing to PDF from your browser.
