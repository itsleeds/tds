# Introduction

[Write your introduction here, explaining the context and importance of your chosen topic]

## Working title

**[Your project title here]**

# Data

[List and briefly describe the datasets you plan to use]

# Research question

**[State your main research question here]**

# Initial analysis

[Describe your planned analysis approach and include any preliminary data exploration]

```{r}
#| include: false
#| label: setup
# Install required packages (update list as needed)
pkgs = c("tidyverse", "stats19", "sf", "nptscot/osmactive")
# Install pak pkg if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install(pkgs)
library(tidyverse)
library(stats19)
library(osmactive)
# Set ggplot2 theme
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

```{r}
#| include: false
#| label: import-clean
collisions_2023 = stats19::get_stats19(year = 2023, type = "collision")
collisions_2023_sf = stats19::format_sf(collisions_2023)
names(collisions_2023_sf)
```

The following code was used to aggregate the data by hour:

```{r}
collisions_hourly = collisions_2023 |>
  mutate(time = lubridate::hour(datetime)) |>
  count(time, accident_severity) 
```

# Initial data exploration

A visualisation of the data is shown below:

```{r}
#| label: spatial-temporal-plot
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| echo: false
collisions_hourly |>
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = n, fill = accident_severity)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") 
head(collisions_2023$police_force)
collisions_2023_sf |>
  filter(police_force == "Metropolitan Police") |>
  plot()
```
