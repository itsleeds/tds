## Questions to consider and discuss with the module team {.incremental}

Around 1 hour for this, in parallel with solo working on projects, providing time for the module to talk to each student

- What are the strongest aspects of your coursework idea so far? What are the weakest?
- What are the priorities over the next three weeks (break it down into a small number of parts)?
- What do you need to find more literature on?
- What do you need more data on (you should have all the data already)?
- What additional skills do you need (now is a good time to ask)?

## Working on your projects

- Plan ahead: what else do you need to do on your project?
- Schedule work: when will you find time to do it?
- Use Microsoft Calendar or similar: put it in the calendar.
- Reproducibility: ensure your .Rmd files are reproducible
- Ask for help: what do you need help with?
- Work: get you head down and make use of this time!
