## What is transport data science?

::: {.incremental}

-   The application of data science to transport datasets and problems
-   Raising the question...
-   What is data science?
-   A discipline "that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" (Grolemund, 2016)

In other words...

-   Statistics that is actually useful!

## Why take Transport Data Science


::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="40%"}
::: incremental
-   New skills (cutting edge R and/or Python packages)
-   Potential for impacts
-   Allows you to do new things with data
-   It might get you a job!

## The history of TDS

-   2017: Transport Data Science created, led by Dr Charles Fox, Computer Scientist, author of Transport Data Science book (Fox, 2018)

-   The focus was on databases and Bayesian methods

-   2019: I inherited the module, which was attended by ITS students

-   Summer 2019: Python code published in the module 'repo':

    -   [github.com/ITSLeeds](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/tree/master/code-python)

## History of TDS II

-   January 2020: Available, Data Science MSc course
-   March 2020: Switch to online teaching
-   2021-2023: Updated module, focus on methods
-   2024: Switch to combined practical sessions and lectures
-   2025+: Expand, online course? book? stay in touch!

## Essential reading

-   Chapter 12, [Transportation](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) of Geocomputation with R, a open book on geographic data in R (available free [online](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)) (Lovelace et al. 2019)
-   Reproducible Road Safety Research with R (RRSRR): https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/

## Core reading materials

-   R for Data Science, an introduction to data science with R (available free [online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/))
-   Python equivalent

## Optional

There are many good resources on data science for transport applications.
Do your own research and reading!
The following are good:

-   If you're interested in network analysis/Python, see this paper on analysing OSM data in Python (Boeing and Waddell, 2017) (available [online](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01890))

-   If you're interested in the range of transport modelling tools, see Lovelace (2021).

## Objectives

<!-- From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md): -->

-   Understand the structure of transport datasets

-   Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data

-   Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets

-   Produce data visualizations, static and interactive

-   <font color="red"> Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio </font>

## Assessment (for those doing this as credit-bearing)

-   You will build-up a portfolio of work
-   100% coursework assessed, you will submit by
-   Written in code - will be graded for reproducibility
-   Code chunks and figures are encouraged
-   You will submit a non-assessed 2 page pdf + qmd

## Feedback

> The module is taught by two really well organised and enthusiastic professors, great module, the seminars, structured and
unstructured learning was great and well thought out, all came together well

> I wish this module was 60 credits instead of 15 because i just want more of it.
