# Desire lines

- Desire lines are origin-destination pairs that have been converted into a geographic data structure

> They represent the quickest ‘bee line’ or ‘crow flies’ route between A and B that would be taken, if it were not for obstacles such as buildings and windy roads getting in the way

`r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018a", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

# Routing services

- Make routing easy: few software requirements
- Reproducible example (requires API key):

```{r}
library(stplanr)
r = route_cyclestreet(from = "Leeds", to = "Bradford")
plot(r)
```
