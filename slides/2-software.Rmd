## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

-  ## <font color="red">Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets</font> 


```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
# Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 
```

## Learning outcomes

-  ## <font color="red">Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services</font> 


```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

# This lecture will...

- Touch on features of GUI-based and CLI-based tools

--

- Present an overview of the data science software landscape

--

- Talk about a few transport-related tools

--

- Demonstrate how to do data science in R

# First up: what are GUIs and CLIs?
