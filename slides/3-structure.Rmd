## Fundamental data types in R

--

Caveat: this workshop is not about how R works, but it's important to know about data types

--

- R is a *vectorised* language, meaning that functions work on many numbers by default

```{r}
x = 9
is.vector(x)
y = x * 1:9
z = sqrt(1:9)
a = letters[1:9]
b = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), length.out = 9)
```

--

- What is the class of each of those numbers?

---

## Data frames

- R was designed for *statistical data analysis* so the main data type in R is the data frame

```{r}
d = data.frame(x, y, z, a, b)
```

--

- Recent innovations allow you to add geographic data as *just another column*, e.g.:

```{r}
z = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "isle-of-wight")
g = z$geometry[1:9]
d$g = g
```

- In fact, a data frame is just a list, you can iterate over each (vector) element:

```{r}
sapply(d, class)
```

---

## Polymorphism and classes

- R is *polymorphic* so if you give it data of a certain class, it guesses what to do with it


A good example of Polymophism is `plot()`, which behaves differently depending on the class of your data

```{r}
methods(plot)
```

---

## The problem with geographic data

- The problem with spatial data is that it needs *context* to work

- How is a computer supposed to know what to do with this, for example:

```{r}
unclass(d$g[1])
```

---

## Classes for spatial data

- Raw coordinate lists in a column do not work:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(d)
# Error
```

```{r}
summary(d[1:3])
```

---

## sf pkg

```{r}
library(sf)
```


 Class systems have evolved so R *knows what to do* with geographic columns:

```{r}
dsf = sf::st_sf(d)
```

---

## sf data frames

- `dsf` is a *geographic data frame* (sf stands for simple features)

--

- Now generic methods work on them to give useful info:

```{r}
dsf
```

---

## Plotting sf objects

Plotting now works by default:

```{r}
plot(dsf)
```

---

## Subsetting vectors in base R

- R allows subsetting in various ways

```{r}
y
```

--

- With integer indices

```{r}
y[2]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y[1:3]; y[c(1, 9)]; y[-c(1:3)] # guess the values
```

--

With logical vectors

```{r}
y[b]
```

---

## Subsetting data frames in base R

- Exactly the same principles apply to data frames:

```{r}
d[2, ]
```

--

- Comma denotes dimension: before comma is rows, after comma columns

```{r}
d[, 2]
```

--

- But subsetting can work in unexpected ways, e.g.:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d[2]; d[[2]]; d[2, 1] # guess the values
```

---

## Subsetting data frames in the tidyverse

- The tidyverse is a collection of packages for data science, the most prominent of which for data manipulation is `dplyr`

```{r}
library(dplyr)

d %>% slice(2) # same as slice(d, 2) or dplyr::slice(d, 2)
```

---

## Filtering and selecting

- `dplyr::filter()` and `select()` are other verbs in **dplyr**

```{r, error=TRUE}
d %>% dplyr::filter(y == 81)
d %>% select(y)
```

---

## Chaining commands

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::filter(b == TRUE) %>% 
  select(x, y, z)
```

```{r}
dsf %>% 
  dplyr::filter(b == TRUE) %>% 
  select(x, y, z)
```


---

## sf objects are sticky

- What just happened (why was `g` still in there)?

---

## Spatial subsetting

We have some geometry data, some of which intersects with `dsf`:

```{r}
l = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight")
plot(dsf$g)
plot(l, add = TRUE)
```




```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(stats19)
a = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "ac", ask = FALSE) %>% 
  format_sf(lonlat = TRUE)
plot(a$geometry)
```

---

## Spatial subsetting II

```{r}
l_sub1 = l[dsf, ]
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot(dsf$g)
plot(l_sub1, add = TRUE) # where did the lines go?
```

---

## Plotting in a different order

```{r}
plot(l$geometry, col = "grey", lwd = 2)
plot(l_sub1$geometry, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
plot(dsf, add = T, col = NA)
```

---

## Spatial operations

- A range of spatial operations can be performed with `sf`

--

- This code, for example, creates a buffer of 500 m around the `dsf` object and 'unions' the result

```{r}
dsfb = dsf %>%
  st_transform(27700) %>% 
  st_buffer(500) %>% 
  st_union() %>% 
  st_transform(4326)
```

---

## The result

```{r}
plot(dsfb)
plot(dsf, add = TRUE)
plot(l_sub1$geometry, add = TRUE)
```

---

## Selecting a subsetting operation

```{r}
l_sub2 = l[dsfb, , op = st_within]
plot(dsfb)
plot(l_sub2$geometry, add = TRUE)
```

---

## Temporal data

```{r}
library(stats19)
library(stringr)
a = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "ac", ask = FALSE) %>% 
  format_sf(lonlat = TRUE)
a$time_formatted = lubridate::hm(a$time)
summary(a$time_formatted)
t1 = lubridate::hm("07:00")
t2 = lubridate::hm("09:00")
summary(a$time_formatted > t1 & a$time_formatted < t2)
a$h = as.numeric(str_sub(a$time, 1, 2))
```
