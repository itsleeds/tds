## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
```

- Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 

---

## Learning outcomes

```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods

---
# Recap

Can be added as follows: 
`r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx:_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

---
## Introduction to transport data science

We defined data science as:

--

- A discipline "that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

--

Meaning transport-related data work that is actually useful!

What other aspects of the definition make data science useful?

--

- Being able to scale to large dataset sizes

--

- Being systematic, driven by code rather than user interfaces, allowing:

--

- Reproducibility

--

- Accountability/transparency

--

- Generalisation and the application of your work (code) to other contexts

---
## Software for transport data science

Coffee data in a GUI vs a CLI

In a GUI:

## The structure of transport data       

- Agents
- Route nets
- Points and nodes
- Routes over a network
- Desire lines and OD pairs
- Transport zones, areal units

Start with the foundational data frame:

```{r, message = FALSE}
u = paste0(
  "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/",
  "raw/master/sample-data/everyone.csv"
  )
d = readr::read_csv(u)
d
```

---

## Recap: data frame manipulation

--

Control your data!

--

```{r}
d[1:2, 1:3]
```

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nrow(d)
d[c(1, 3), c(2, 7)]
d[3]
d[, c(3)]
d$x = 1:nrow(d)
sum(d$n_coffee[d$like_bus_travel])
```

--

## Challenge for practical: do that in the tidyverse!

---
## Data cleaning and subsetting          


--

- Data cleaning (or 'tidying' or 'wrangling') is part of a wider process 
`r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/795c039ba2520455d833b4034befc8cf360a70ba/558a5/diagrams/data-science-explore.png")
```

--

- It's important to have an idea where you're heading with the analysis

--

- Often best to start with pen and paper

---
## Accessing data from web sources

--

There is tons of data out there, being able to get it is a vital skill

--

- UK geoportal, providing geographic data at many levels: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk
- Other national geoportals exist, such as this: http://www.geoportal.org/
- A good source of cleaned origin destination data is the Region downloads tab in the Propensity to Cycle Tool - see the Region data tab for West Yorkshire here, for example: http://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire
- OpenStreetMap is an excellent source of geographic data with global coverage. You can download data on specific queries (e.g. highway=cycleway) from the overpass-turbo service: https://overpass-turbo.eu/ or with the **osmdata** package

---
## Routing

```{r}
o = stplanr::geo_code("leeds")
d = stplanr::geo_code("bradford")
l = stplanr::route_osrm(o, d)
plot(sf::st_as_sf(l))
```


---
## Data visualization                    

> [visualisations] are also often the best way to present the findings of [transport] research in a way that is accessible. [visualisation] making is therefore a critical part of [transport] and its emphasis not only on describing, but also changing the world.

Source: [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html)

--


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/31/1414751968306/d83dffac-d060-4b77-88c0-77916e18e233-1020x397.png?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=7a52a871a27b3fa6ae167244d4f9845e")
```

- Visualisations can make findings become 'real'


---
## Project work

---
## Machine learning                   

There are 2 basic types `r Citep(my_bib, "james_introduction_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

- Supervised learning, when you have a training dataset

- Unsupervised learning, where there is no 'dependent variable'
