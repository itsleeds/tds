## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

-  ## <font color="red">Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets</font> 


```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
# Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 
```

---

## Learning outcomes

-  ## <font color="red">Identify available datasets and access and clean them</font> 


```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

---

# Key concepts in data cleaning

## Data science workflow

--

- Data cleaning (or 'tidying' or 'wrangling') is part of a wider process 
`r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/795c039ba2520455d833b4034befc8cf360a70ba/558a5/diagrams/data-science-explore.png")
```

--

- It's important to have an idea where you're heading with the analysis

--

- Often best to start with pen and paper

---

## Project management

--

- Data science is just one component of any project 
`r Citep(my_bib, "gillespie_efficient_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
section 4.3: [csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#project-planning-and-management)

```

]


.pull-right[

Source: `r Citet(my_bib, "lovelace_propensity_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

- Much of the 'legwork' was data cleaning

- Hours spent cleaning data at the project outset saved many hours later on

- Result: http://www.pct.bike/

---

# The data source 

- For reproducibility always link to the data source

- Keep a copy of the input dataset

- Save intermediate 'clean' datasets in appropriate formats
