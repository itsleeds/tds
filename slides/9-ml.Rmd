## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
```

- Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 

---

## Learning outcomes

```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

- Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques

# Machine learning types

There are 2 basic types `r Citep(my_bib, "james_introduction_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

- Supervised learning, when you have a training dataset

- Unsupervised learning, where there is no 'dependent variable'

# Deep learning

# Example of a machine learning problem

- Cycling infrastructure is a 'fuzzy' concept

- Difficult to pin down with a simple relationship

- So machine learning should help!

# Input data - messy

# Observations

- Input data is very noisy

--

- Machine learning didn't reveal any expected insights in this case

--

- But did reveal *unexpected* insight: road speeds and traffic volumes seem to be associated with lower uptake of cycling

---

# Practical

- Generate a working hypothesis present in data you have analysed for your research portfolio (e.g. car use is negatively associated with active modes)

--

- Use a conventional statistical model, e.g. with the function `lm()`, to test the hypothesis

--

- Use a machine learning algorithm, e.g. that provided by `xgboost`, to explore the same relationships

--

- Bonus: use a Bayesian statistical approach, e.g. with the package `brms` to explore the relationship

--

Identify pros and cons of each approach
