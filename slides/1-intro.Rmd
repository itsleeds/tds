# The history of TDS

- I inhereited this module from Charles Fox
- Computer scientist by training, he ran it for 2 years
- Expertise in Python for Bayesian methods and machine learning
- Wrote lots of Python code that now lives in the module 'repo':
  - [github.com/ITSLeeds](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/tree/master/code-python)
- Author of Transport Data Science book `r Citep(my_bib, "fox_data_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
```

- <font color="red"> Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio  </font> 

---

## Learning outcomes

```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods

---

## What is transport data science?



---

## Personal objectives

- Quick go around: what is your name, level and aspiration?

--

- Get into groups of 2-3 and discuss:

--

- What do you hope to get out of it personally?

--

- In terms of future work in an evolving job market?

--

- In terms of the kinds of problems you want to solve?

# Citations

Can be added as follows:
`r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx:_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).
