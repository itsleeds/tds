# The history of TDS

- I inhereited this module from Charles Fox
- Computer scientist by training, he ran it for 2 years
- Expertise in Python for Bayesian methods and machine learning
- Wrote lots of Python code that now lives in the module 'repo':
  - [github.com/ITSLeeds](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/tree/master/code-python)
- Author of Transport Data Science book `r Citep(my_bib, "fox_data_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
```

- <font color="red"> Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio  </font> 

---

## Learning outcomes

```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods

---

## What is transport data science?

- The application of data science to transport datasets and problems

--

- Raising the question...

--

- What is data science?

<!-- You tell me! -->

--

- A discipline "that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

--

In other words...

- Statistics that is actually useful!

---

## What is science?

.pull-left[
- Scientific knowledge is hypotheses that can be falsified
- Science is the process of *generating falsifiable hypotheses* and *testing them*
- In a reproducible way
- Systematically

]

--

.pull-right[

- Falsifiability is central to the scientific process `r Citep(my_bib, "popper_logic_1959", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- All of which requires software conducive to reproducibility

## Transport planning software

Transport modelling software products are a vital component of modern transport planning *and* research.

- They generate the evidence base on which strategic investments are made and, furthermore,
- provide a powerful mechanism for researching alternative futures.

--

It would not be an overstatement to say that software determines the range of futures that are visible to policymakers. This makes status of transport modelling software and how it may evolve in the future important questions.

What will transport software look like? What will their capabilities be? And who will control? Answers to each of these questions will affect the future of transport systems. 

--

- Premise: transport planning/modelling software used in practice ~~will become~~ is becoming increasingly data-driven, modular and open. 

---

---

## Personal objectives

- Quick go around: what is your name, level and aspiration?

--

- Get into groups of 2-3 and discuss:

--

- What do you hope to get out of it personally?

--

- In terms of future work in an evolving job market?

--

- In terms of the kinds of problems you want to solve?
