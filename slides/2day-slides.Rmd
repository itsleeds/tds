--

### How about you?

---

## Housekeeping

- The venue + facilities
- The agenda + further info can be found on the course website:
- git.io/tds2day

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/master/courses/tds-oneday_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png")
```

---

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Find, download and import a variety of transport datasets, including from OpenStreetMap and government data portals
- Work with, analyse and model transport data with spatial, temporal and demographic attributes
- Generate and analyse route networks for transport planning with reference to:
    - Origin-destination (OD) data
    - Geographic desire lines
    - Route allocation using different routing services
    - Route network generation and analysis
---

## What is transport data science?

- The application of data science to transport datasets and problems

--

- Raising the question...

--

- What is data science?

<!-- You tell me! -->

--

- A discipline "that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

--

In other words...

- Statistics that is actually useful!

---

## A geographic perspective

- See https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md

- Paper on the **stplanr** paper for transport planning (available [online](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr-paper.html)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_stplanr_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- Introductory and advanced content on geographic data in R, especially the [transport chapter](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) (available free [online](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 
- Paper on analysing OSM data in Python `r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` (available [online](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01890)) 

```{r geocompr-cover, echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/images/cover.png")
```

---


## Data science and the tidyverse

- Inspired by Introduction to data science with R (available free [online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`


```{r tds-cover, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b88ef926a004b0fce72b2526b0b5c4413666a4cb/24a30/cover.png")
```

---

## Transport software options

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# file.copy("../transport-software.csv", ".")
tms = readr::read_csv("transport-software.csv")[1:5]
tms = dplyr::arrange(tms, dplyr::desc(Citations))
knitr::kable(tms, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Sample of transport modelling software in use by practitioners. Note: citation counts based on searches for company/developer name, the product name and 'transport'. Data source: Google Scholar searches, October 2018.", format = "html")
```

# Getting help online

- [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions) has 21,314 questions 

- [r-sig-geo](http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/) has 1000s of posts

- RStudio's Discourse community has 65,000+ posts already!

--

- No transport equivalent (e.g. earthscience.stackexchange.com is in beta)

- Potential for a Discourse forum or similar: transport is not (just) GIS

---

## How is data science used in the PCT?

- It's all reproducible, e.g.:
- Find short in which more people drive than cycle

--

- Stage 1: get data from web

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: get top 1000 lines in repo
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight")
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(1000, all)
write_sf(desire_lines, "desire_lines.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("desire_lines.geojson")
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set-up, after installing pct and checking out www.pct.bike:
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight") %>% 
  top_n(n = 1000, wt = all)
```

---

## Stage II: Geographic data analysis

- Interested only in top 200 lines

```{r}
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(n = 20, wt = all)
```


---

## Stage III: Visualising (polution) data

<!-- A fundamental part of data science is being able to understand your data. -->

<!-- That requires visualisation, R is great for that: -->

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
.pull-left[
plot(desire_lines)
]
.pull-right[
]
```


<!-- - Interactively: -->

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines("all") +
  tm_basemap(server = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap)
```


---

## Stage IV: Origin-destination data analysis

- Now we have data in our computer, and verified it works, we can use it

- Which places are most car dependent? 

```{r}
car_dependent_routes = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(rf_dist_km < 3 & rf_dist_km > 1) 
```

- Get routes

```{r}
routes = stplanr::line2route(car_dependent_routes)
car_dependent_routes$geometry = routes$geometry
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# sf::write_sf(car_dependent_routes, "car_dependent_routes.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_upload("car_dependent_routes.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_download_url("car_dependent_routes.geojson")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# car_dependent_routes = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.2/car_dependent_routes.geojson")
```



---

## Communicating results:

```{r}
b = c(0, 25, 50, 75)
tm_shape(car_dependent_routes) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5, breaks = b, palette = "-inferno")
```

---

## Upcoming...
