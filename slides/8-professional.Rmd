# What is machine learning?

--

- [Applied statistics](https://machinelearningmastery.com/relationship-between-applied-statistics-and-machine-learning/) vs ML: a continuum

# Machine learning types

There are 2 basic types `r Citep(my_bib, "james_introduction_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

- Supervised learning, when you have a training dataset

- Unsupervised learning, where there is no 'dependent variable'



---

# Deep learning

- Google is now 'AI First' (NYT [2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html))

# Example of a machine learning problem

- Cycling infrastructure is a 'fuzzy' concept

- Difficult to pin down with a simple relationship

- So machine learning should help!

- See www.cyipt.bike

# Input data - messy

# Input data - simplification

# Observations

- Input data is very noisy

--

- Machine learning didn't reveal any expected insights in this case

--

- But did reveal *unexpected* insight: road speeds and traffic volumes seem to be associated with lower uptake of cycling

---

# Practical

- What are the strongest aspects of your coursework so far? What are the weakest?

--

- What are the priorities over the next three weeks (break it down into 3 parts) 

--

- What do you need to find more literature on?

--

- What do you need more data on (you should have all the data already)?

--

- What additional skills do you need (now is a good time to ask)?
