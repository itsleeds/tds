## Course Overview

Based on demand, we're organising a 2-day course teaching modern data science skills for transport planning, focussed on transport planning practitioners.
This course will take place on the 18th and 19th of September.

<!-- ## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of data science in transport planning.
- Learn how find, import, clean, and analyze transport data.
- Develop skills in data visualization and reporting. -->

## Prerequisites

- Experience with transport planning concepts and datasets, such as origin-destination data and route networks.
- Basic programming skills in R, Python or similar.
- A laptop with R and RStudio (recommended) or a Python distribution such as Anaconda and an editor such as VS Code or Jupyter Notebook set-up.
