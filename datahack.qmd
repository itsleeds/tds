# Introduction

This event is designed to build data, coding and reproducible research skills for Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) staff and students.
It is also specifically designed to support ITS MSc students with their dissertation projects by providing a space to ask questions about importing, processing and visualising data.

It will take place on Thursday 7th May 2026.
It is open to staff and students at ITS.
Contact the organisers (Robin Lovelace) if you are not based at the University of Leeds and would like to join in.

See [here to sign-up](https://forms.office.com/e/A1ABvMuJAG).

## Objectives

- To create a supportive space for participants to ask questions about working with datasets in general and using data science techniques for working with transport datasets in particular
- Get support importing datasets for MSc dissertations and other projects
- Data wrangling with the `tidyverse` R package and other tools
- Learning the general skill of data visualisation and gain specific experience working with tap/on/tap/out data
- Showcase the potential of open data (transparency, participation, research) and reproducible/open work-flows

## Prerequisites

- None: just an interest in transport data and a willingness to learn
- Useful: if you have experience with GitHub R, Python or other tools for reproducible data analysis you can join in with the coding, see the [Transport Data Science module](https://itsleeds.github.io/tds) for more details

## Schedule

- 13:00 - 13:30: Introduction to importing, processing and visualising data with RStudio
  - An indroduction to RStudio
  - An introduction to Quarto for reproducible reports
  - An example with origin-destination data in Leeds
- 13:30 - 14:00: Importing your datasets
  - Installing any necessary packages
  - Requesting support for any issues
- 14:00 - 14:05: Break
- 14:05 - 15:00: Solo working on your datasets, asking questions, and getting support
- 15:15 - 15:45: Presentation of the results (optional for participants)
  - An opportunity for participants to share what they learned
- 15:45 - 16:00: Networking and sharing ideas

## Prizes

The prize will be Geocomputation with Python or Geocomputation with R (second edition).
Prizes will be awarded based on importing, analysing and helping to document the challenge datasets (see Challenges section below):

- Best technical implementation and code
- Most creative or impactful use of data

The presentations will be assessed by the organisers.

# Challenges

- Write code to automatically download datasets used in your dissertation (if available online) and import them into RStudio
- Subset the dataset to a particular area, time period or other criteria
- Create a Quarto report with a summary of the data and analysis
