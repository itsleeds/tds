## Assessment Summary Guidance

This summative coursework requires you to complete a data science project addressing a transport-related research question. Your topic must be entirely different from the one chosen for coursework 1. The submission should demonstrate your ability to process and analyze transport data, create meaningful visualizations, and draw policy-relevant conclusions.

## Use of GenAI

**Generative AI Category: AMBER**  
Under this category, AI tools can be used in an assistive role.  

In this assessment, AI tools can be utilised to:  
- Support code debugging and optimization
- Assist with data processing techniques
- Help with visualization approaches
- Provide feedback on writing clarity

AI tools **cannot** be used to:  
- Generate complete sections of the report
- Perform the core analysis
- Make key analytical decisions

The use of Generative AI must be acknowledged in an **'Acknowledgements'** section, including:  
- Name and version of the AI system
- Publisher
- URL
- Brief description of use

For detailed guidance, see [Generative AI and Assessments](https://generative-ai.leeds.ac.uk/ai-and-assessments/categories-of-assessments/).
