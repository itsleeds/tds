## Assessment summary

This summative coursework requires you to complete a data science project addressing a transport-related research question. Your topic must be entirely different from the one chosen for coursework 1. The submission should demonstrate your ability to process and analyze transport data, create meaningful visualizations, and draw policy-relevant conclusions.


# Use of GenAI

**Generative AI category: AMBER**

Under this category, AI tools can be used in an assistive role.

In this assessment, AI tools can be utilised in an assistive role to:

- act as a support tutor supporting your research on the topic. e.g. to ask clarifying questions or to suggest areas to investigate.
- testing and debugging of any code you produce yourself as part of the assignment.
- provide ideas or inspiration to help you overcome a creative block.
- give feedback on content or provide proof reading of content that you have generated yourself.

In this assessment, AI tools cannot be utilised to:

- produce the entirety of, or sections of, a piece of work that you submit for assessment beyond that which is outlined above.

The use of Generative AI must be acknowledged in an ‘Acknowledgements’ section of any piece of academic work where it has been used as a functional tool to assist in the process of creating academic work.

The minimum requirement to include in acknowledgement:

- Name and version of the generative AI system used e.g. ChatGPT-4.0
- Publisher (company that made the AI system) e.g. OpenAI
- URL of the AI system
- Brief description (single sentence) of context in which the tool was used.

For example: “I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT-3.5 (Open AI, <https://chat.openai.com/>) to summarise my initial notes and to proofread my final draft.
Best practice is to include a link to the exact prompt used to generate the content, e.g. https://g.co/gemini/share/4933efa27596

The standard Academic Misconduct procedure applies for students believed to have ignored this categorisation.

# Assessment criteria

Marks will be awarded based on the information provided in the [marking criteria](https://itsleeds.github.io/tds/marking-criteria.html) document.

# Academic misconduct and plagiarism

The university expects that all the work you do, which includes all forms of assessments submitted and examinations taken, meet the university’s standard for Academic Integrity.
All forms of Academic Integrity are investigated through the Academic Misconduct Procedure.
This applies to all taught elements of your study, including undergraduate programmes, taught postgraduate study, and taught elements of research degrees.
Breaching academic integrity standards can lead to serious penalties.

Guidance on Academic Integrity and Academic Misconduct can be found on the [For Students website pages](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10110/academic-integrity).
Full definitions of offences under the Academic Misconduct Procedure can be found in the [Academic Misconduct Procedure](https://secretariat.leeds.ac.uk/student-cases/academic-misconduct/).

# Academic integrity

All work must meet university standards for Academic Integrity.
See the [For Students website](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10110/academic-integrity) for guidance.

# Resit information

If you fail the module, you will be given the opportunity to resit the assessment. The resit will be capped at the pass mark (50%).

You will submit as before:

- A `.zip` file containing:
  - A PDF document (max 10 pages)
  - Reproducible code (`.qmd` file)
  - Any necessary data files, but do not include any large (above around 10 MB) datasets: provide links to these instead
  - Maximum file size: 40 MB
- Submission: Via Minerva (Blackboard Assignment)

For the coursework you will submit a pdf a document with a maximum of 10 pages that contains code and results demonstrating your transport data science skills.

The topic must be completely different from the topic chosen in your first submission
