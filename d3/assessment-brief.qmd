## Deadline

**Submission deadline**: 15th May 2026, 14:00

## Submission Method

- A `.zip` file containing:
  - A PDF document (max 10 pages)
  - Reproducible code (`.qmd` file)
  - Any necessary data files, but do not include any large (above around 10 MB) datasets: provide links to these instead
  - Maximum file size: 40 MB

## Feedback provision

When there is more than one assessment on a module, you will usually receive your feedback before your next assessment for the module is due. Where it is appropriate to do so, and feedback can be released without invalidating the integrity of ongoing assessments, this will typically be no later than 15 working days post submission. Please be mindful that some students may have approved extensions for assessments which mean it is not appropriate to release feedback within 15 working days after individual submissions. In these cases, feedback will be released no later than 15 working days following the submission of all outstanding work for the assessment.

## Assessment summary guidance

In ITS Assessment Instructions will be made available separately. Your module leader will tell you when to expect the Assessment Instructions to be available. When the Assessment Instructions are made available you will be able to find them in the Assessment and Feedback Folder on the module Minerva Page.

This summative coursework requires you to complete a data science project addressing a transport-related research question. Your topic must be entirely different from the one chosen for coursework 1. The submission should demonstrate your ability to process and analyze transport data, create meaningful visualizations, and draw policy-relevant conclusions.


# Use of GenAI

**Generative AI category: GREEN**

Under this category, AI tools are actively encouraged and can be used extensively.

In this assessment, AI tools can be utilised to:

- Generate, test, and debug code for your transport data analysis
- Assist with data visualization and mapping
- Provide explanations of transport concepts and methods
- Help with code optimization and best practices
- Support your research on the topic by suggesting areas to investigate
- Give feedback on content and provide proofreading
- Accelerate your learning and productivity

**Important:** You must understand and be able to explain all code and analysis you submit, whether AI-generated or not. Document your AI usage in reflective sections of your report.

In this assessment, AI tools cannot be utilised to:

- produce the entirety of, or sections of, a piece of work that you submit for assessment beyond that which is outlined above.

The use of Generative AI must be acknowledged in an ‘Acknowledgements’ section of any piece of academic work where it has been used as a functional tool to assist in the process of creating academic work.

The minimum requirement to include in acknowledgement:

- Name and version of the generative AI system used e.g. ChatGPT-4.0
- Publisher (company that made the AI system) e.g. OpenAI
- URL of the AI system
- Brief description (single sentence) of context in which the tool was used.

For example: “I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT-3.5 (Open AI, <https://chat.openai.com/>) to summarise my initial notes and to proofread my final draft.
Best practice is to include a link to the exact prompt used to generate the content, e.g. https://g.co/gemini/share/4933efa27596

The standard Academic Misconduct procedure applies for students believed to have ignored this categorisation.

For detailed guidance see <https://generative-ai.leeds.ac.uk/>

- Use consistent citation format
- Provide complete references

You must appropriately cite all supporting evidence using the Leeds Harvard referencing style - https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1402/referencing/50/leeds-harvard-introduction

See [Quarto Citation Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html#citations) for reference formatting.

# Assessment criteria and process

The detailed marking rubric for this assessment will be included in the Assessment Instructions that will be made available separately.

Moderation process are detailed in the University Assessment Policy & Procedures.

Late penalties are detailed in the University Assessment Policy & Procedures. Any criteria or penalties specific to this assignment (e.g. penalties that for pedagogical reasons differ from what is presented in the Faculty CoPA or School Annex) must be outlined here.

Assessment length penalties are applied during the marking process & will normally be applied before you receive your mark. Late penalties are normally applied after you receive your mark – if you know you submitted late without a permitted extension, please be aware that your mark may change.

In ITS written English is assessed in line with the University’s policies on Assessment of written English (Student Education Service | University of Leeds). You should use spelling, punctuation & grammar to communicate your ideas clearly.

Marks will be awarded based on the information provided in the [marking criteria](https://itsleeds.github.io/tds/marking-criteria.html) document.

# Academic misconduct and plagiarism

The university expects that all the work you do, which includes all forms of assessments submitted and examinations taken, meet the university’s standard for Academic Integrity.
All forms of Academic Integrity are investigated through the Academic Misconduct Procedure.
This applies to all taught elements of your study, including undergraduate programmes, taught postgraduate study, and taught elements of research degrees.
Breaching academic integrity standards can lead to serious penalties.

Guidance on Academic Integrity and Academic Misconduct can be found on the [For Students website pages](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10110/academic-integrity).
Full definitions of offences under the Academic Misconduct Procedure can be found in the [Academic Misconduct Procedure](https://secretariat.leeds.ac.uk/student-cases/academic-misconduct/).

# Academic integrity

All work must meet university standards for Academic Integrity.
See the [For Students website](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10110/academic-integrity) for guidance.

  - Maximum file size: 40 MB
- Submission: Via Minerva (Blackboard Assignment)

For the coursework you will submit a PDF document with a maximum of 10 pages that contains code and results demonstrating your transport data science skills.

The topic must be completely different from the topic chosen in your original Summative Assessment submission
