## Overview

This is the final assessed coursework submission for the Transport Data Science module. The deadline is **16th May 2025, 14:00**.

The purpose of the coursework is to provide a professional-quality report on the data science project you have worked on.
You should include a range of techniques and methods you have learned during the module, and apply them to a real-world transport problem.
The project report should be a cohesive whole, however, not a disjointed portfolio of separate tasks.

A good way to think about the project report is to imagine that you have worked on an important data science project in a large organisation and you are presenting your findings with a view to impressing them with your skills, clearly communicating your results, and providing actionable insights that motivate change.
