# TDS (Transport Data Science)

This repo support teaching of the Transport Data Science module, part of the Mathematical Modelling for Transport ([MMT](http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/courses/masters/msc-mathematical-modelling-transport/)) MSc course at the Institute for Transport Studies.

The module catalogue can be found at [`catalogue.md`](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md).
The code accompanying the course can be found in the `code` folders.
To run this code you will need R and Python installed plus various packages and libraries.
This software has been packaged-up into a docker container to ease teaching.

See here for the the timetable:

- In .ics form (recommended): https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/tds-timetable.ics
- As a .csv file: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/timetable.csv
- On the University's system (official): http://timetable.leeds.ac.uk/teaching/201819/reporting/Individual?objectclass=module&idtype=name&identifier=TRAN5340M01&&template=SWSCUST+module+Individual&days=1-7&weeks=1-52&periods=1-21

# Software

After you have [installed docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), you should be able to run the software by executing the following commands in a terminal such as Windows PowerShell or the default terminal on Linx and MAC operating systems:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/data robinlovelace/tds  
```

This will:

- Pull the docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/robinlovelace/tds/ if it's not already on your computer
- Launch a locally hosted instance of RStudio Server which can be accessed at http://localhost:8787/
- Mount your current working dirctory to the data folder in the home directly of the docker image

After navigating to http://localhost:8787/ in a browser you should see a login screen. Username and password are rstudio. See https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image for details.

Once in the container you can use all the R packages.
To access the pre-installed Python packages you will need to enter the following commands:

```bash
conda activate
python
```

to go into the Python shell. Form more on running Python in RStudio see [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/t/r-python-in-ide/279).
A demonstration showing the `tds` docker image in action is illustrated below.

# Data

Data for course can be accessed from the repos [Releases](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases) page.
You can, for example, download and unzip the data folder in a local version of the repo (accessed by downloading and unzipp https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/archive/master.zip ) with the following R commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/data.zip", destfile = "data.zip")
unzip("data.zip")
```

If you want to be clever you can use the piggyback package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("piggyback")
piggyback::pb_download("data.zip")

# (This package was used to upload the data with:)
# piggyback::pb_upload(file = "data.zip")
# piggyback::pb_upload(file = "codeExamples.zip")
```

To publish the slides and other content online, the following commands were used:

```bash
# first time
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .

# create a hidden file .nojekyll
touch .nojekyll
git add .nojekyll

git commit -m"Initial commit"
git push origin gh-pages
