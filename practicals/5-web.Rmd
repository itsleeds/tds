## Discussion of homework and worked example (30 minutes)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

## Accessing crowd-sourced data from OSM

- Download data on highway=cycleway for Leeds from https://overpass-turbo.eu/

- Load the data in R and plot it with your favourite plotting package (e.g. `sf`, `mapview` or `tmap`)

- Now try to get the same data using the **osmdata** package

## Get official data with stats19

- Download data on road crashes in Great Britain in 2017
- Filter crashes that happened in Leeds
- Filter crashes that happened within a 10m buffer of the cycle infrastructure
- Bonus: pull down origin-destination data with the `pct` package hosted at: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct

## Homework

- Add a data access section to your in progress portfolio
