## Thinking about (transport) data science (10 minutes)

- How do you see yourself using data science over the next 1 year, 5 years, 20 years?
- What did you get out of the course?
- What datasets have you come across at these levels?:

- Zones
- Points
- Routes
- Route networks
- Individual

## Practical, group computer task (80 minutes)

Starting with the following code, read-in data on coffee use:

```{r}
u = paste0(
  "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/",
  "raw/master/sample-data/everyone.csv"
  )
d = readr::read_csv(u)
d
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
nrow(d)
d[c(1, 3), c(2, 7)]
d[3]
d[, c(3)]
d$x = 1:nrow(d)
sum(d$n_coffee[d$like_bus_travel])
```


Re-do those same operations in the tidyverse!
