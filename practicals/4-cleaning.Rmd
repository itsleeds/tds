## Review of homework exercise: demo then individual Q&A

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```



## Data cleaning on a big dataset

Download the file `wu03ew_v2.zip` from the Wicid website:
[wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk](http://wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk/cider/wicid/downloads.php).
You should be able to read it in as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
unzip("~/Downloads/wu03ew_v2.zip")
d = read_csv("wu03ew_v2.csv")
```

Load data representing MSOA zones in Leeds.
You could download zones from a number of places, including https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/geography.aspx

An easy way to get zone data for Leeds is with the `ukboundaries` github package, which can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("robinlovelace/ukboundaries")
```

The zones for Leeds can be shown as follows

```{r}
zones = ukboundaries::msoa2011_lds
plot(zones$geometry)
```

## Processing/cleaning

- Clean the names of the `d` object, e.g. using the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
names(d) = snakecase::to_snake_case(names(d))
names(d)[5] = "metro"
```

- Create a new variable called `pcycle` representing the percentage cycling in each OD pair

- Create a minimal version of the dataset `d` only containing a few key variables

- What proportion of people in England and Wales are represented in the dataset `d`

- Create a subset of the object `d` called `d_leeds_origins` that only contains routes that originate in leeds

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
d_leeds_origins = d %>% 
  filter(work_mainly_at_or_from_home %in% zones$geo_code)
```

- Create a subset that contains only od pairs with origins and destinations in Leeds

## Working on your own datset / project portfolio

- Identify, download and clean a dataset to include in your coursework portfolio .Rmd document
