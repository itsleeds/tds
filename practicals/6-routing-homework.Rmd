## Prior set-up and reading (before practical)

We will use [ITS Go](https://itsleeds.github.io/go/) to do an easy setup of your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("https://git.io/JvGjF")
```

If that does not work the packages we will be using are:

* sf
* tidyverse
* tmap
* pct
* stplanr
* dodgr
* opentripplanner
* igraph
* ITSleeds/geofabrik

Make sure that you have installed these.

Read the OpenTripPlanner package paper for information on routing [@morgan_opentripplanner_2019].

## The practical (during and after practical)

Ensure that you have completed the exercises in the practical session (see the [`practicals.2f6-routing.pdf`](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.20.1/practicals.2f6-routing.pdf) file in https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases )

## An RMarkdown template

- Read Chapter 2 of the definitive guide to the .Rmd file format [@xie_r_2018]: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html

- Create a new project called `tdsproject` (or similar) and create a new RMarkdown file by running the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

On line 32 of the resulting file, replace this line

```
plot(pressure)
```

with this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
m1 = lm(pressure ~ temperature, data = pressure)
plot(pressure)
lines(pressure$temperature, m1$fitted.values, col = "red")
```

Knit the file. You should see something that looks like this.
What is wrong with the prediction?

Challenge: generate a model prediction that more accurately models the relationship between pressure and temperature (hint: the code ` + I(temperature^2)` may help, the result should look something like that shown below).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m1 = lm(pressure ~ temperature, data = pressure)
m2 = lm(pressure ~ temperature + I(temperature^2), data = pressure)
m3 = lm(log(pressure) ~ temperature + I(temperature^2), data = pressure)
plot(pressure)
lines(pressure$temperature, m1$fitted.values, col = "red")
lines(pressure$temperature, m2$fitted.values, col = "blue")
lines(pressure$temperature, exp(m3$fitted.values), col = "yellow")
```

Try to reproduce the output of this file: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/coursework-template.Rmd

The results should look something like this: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/coursework-template.md

Challenge: knit the document to create a file called coursework-template.pdf.
