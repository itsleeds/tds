## Thinking about (transport) data science (15 minutes)

- Based on the contents of the lecture, come up with *your own* definition of data science
- Name 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages of this approach to transport research
- How do you see yourself using data science over the next 1 year, 5 years, 20 years
- Quick go around: what is your name, level and background?
- Get into groups of 2-3 and discuss:

## Thinking about this course

- What do you hope to get out of it personally?
- In terms of future work in an evolving job market?
- In terms of the kinds of problems you want to solve?

## Sketching research methods (in groups of 2-4, 45 minutes)

Starting with the 1000 'desire lines' dataset of Leeds, sketch-out some research ideas that cover

1) Hypotheses: generate two hypotheses that are falsifiable and 2 hypotheses that are not falsifiable

2) Input data: draw schematic representations of additional datasets that you could use alongside the desire lines dataset, with at least one at each of these levels:

- Zones
- Points
- Routes
- Route networks
- Individual

What temporal and spatial resolution could each one have?

3) Methods: using a flow diagram (e.g. as shown below)

```{r schematic, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/flow-model/flow-diag2.png")
```

## Practical, group computer task (15 minutes)

Building on the follow code chunk (but with no copy-and-pasting), create a data frame that contains the names, coffee habits and like/dislike of bus travel for everyone in your group.


```{r}
person_name = c(
  "robin",
  "malcolm",
  "richard"
)
n_coffee = c(
  5,
  1,
  0
)
like_bus_travel = c(
  TRUE,
  FALSE,
  TRUE
)
personal_data = data.frame(person_name, n_coffee, like_bus_travel)
personal_data
```

When you are complete, send the code to me: r.lovelace@leeds.ac.uk

## Learning outcomes

```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods
