Note: before you run this tutorial, ensure that you have recently updated R and RStudio on your computer.
Furthermore, you will need to have installed a number of packages, as described here: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/articles/stats19-training-setup.html

There is one additional package that you will need that is not available on CRAN which can be installed as follows (see [Chapter 2 of Geocomputation With R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html) for details, this requires the package remotes):

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Nowosad/spDataLarge")
```

## Agenda {-}

1. Thinking about transport data science (20 min)
2. Questions about the homework (10 min)
3. Practical 2 (2.5 hrs)


# Thinking about (transport) data science 

- Based on the contents of the lecture, come up with *your own* definition of data science
- How do you see yourself using data science over the next 1 year, 5 years, 20 years
- What do you hope to get out of it personally?
- Bonus: think of a question about a transport system you know well and how data science could help answer it, perhaps with reference to a sketch like that below

#### How much potential is there for cycling across the transport network? {-}

# Questions about homework

1. Reproduce this script: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct/blob/master/inst/test-setup.R
2. Work through the transport chapter of Geocomputation with R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html

# Practical 2

See https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/2-software.md


<!-- - In terms of future work in an evolving job market? -->
<!-- - In terms of the kinds of problems you want to solve? -->

<!-- ## Sketching research methods (in groups of 2-4, 30 minutes) -->

<!-- Starting with the 1000 'desire lines' dataset of Leeds, sketch-out some research ideas that cover -->

<!-- 1) Hypotheses: generate two hypotheses that are falsifiable and 2 hypotheses that are not falsifiable -->

<!-- 2) Input data: draw schematic representations of additional datasets that you could use alongside the desire lines dataset, with at least one at each of these levels: -->

<!-- - Zones -->
<!-- - Points -->
<!-- - Routes -->
<!-- - Route networks -->
<!-- - Individual -->

<!-- What temporal and spatial resolution could each one have? -->

<!-- 3) Methods: using a flow diagram (e.g. as shown below) -->

```{r schematic, echo=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/flow-model/flow-diag2.png")
```

<!-- ## Practical, group computer task (30 minutes) -->

<!-- Create a github account (all). See: https://github.com -->

<!-- Building on the follow code chunk (but with no copy-and-pasting), create a data frame that contains the names, coffee habits and like/dislike of bus travel for everyone in your group (just 1 computer per group): -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- person_name = c( -->
<!--   "robin", -->
<!--   "malcolm", -->
<!--   "richard" -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- n_coffee = c( -->
<!--   5, -->
<!--   1, -->
<!--   0 -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- like_bus_travel = c( -->
<!--   TRUE, -->
<!--   FALSE, -->
<!--   TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- personal_data = data.frame(person_name, n_coffee, like_bus_travel) -->
<!-- personal_data -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- When you are complete, add your code to https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/code-r/01-person-data.R -->

<!-- ## Learning outcomes -->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

<!-- - Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods -->
