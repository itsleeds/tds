## Review of homework exercise: demo then individual Q&A

## Practical demo of zones and lines (in groups)

- Read-in top 1000 desire lines for Leeds with the following code (hint: rather than typing the url of the file you can copy-paste it from [github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS)):

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/desire_lines.geojson"

download.file(u, "desire_lines.geojson")
desire_lines = read_sf("desire_lines.geojson")
# note: you can also read-in the file from the url:
# desire_lines = read_sf(u)
```

Plot the lines statically as follows:

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines()
```

Plot the lines showing the number of car drivers as follows:

```{r}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "car_driver")
```

- Plot the same lines, but with colour according to the number of people who walked to work in the 2011 Census

```{r, include=FALSE}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "foot")
```

- Re-do the plot of the number of trips made by driving, but make the line widths proportional to the total number (`all`) trips made (hint: you may need to set the scale with `scale = 5`, or another number greater than 1, for example)

```{r, include=FALSE}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "foot", lwd = "all", scale = 9)
```

Filter-out all lines between 1 and 3km and call the resulting object`desire_lines_1_5km` with the following command (or similar):

```{r}
desire_lines_1_5km = desire_lines %>% 
  filter(e_dist_km > 1 & e_dist_km < 3)
```

- Plot the results to make sure the operation worked (you should get a result like the on below):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(desire_lines_1_5km$geometry)
```

Create a new variable called `percent_drive` that contains the percentage of trips driven in each of the lines in the `desire_lines_1_5km` object with the following command:

```{r}
desire_lines_pcar = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100)
```

- Find the top 100 most 'car dependent' short desire lines in West Yorkshire and plot the results. It should look something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
car_dep_100 = desire_lines_pcar %>% 
  top_n(n = 100, wt = percent_drive)
tm_shape(car_dep_100) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5)
```

- Plot the results in an interactive map and explore the results. Where are the top 100 most car-dependent major commuting desire lines in West Yorkshire (hint: you may use the `ttm()` function to switch to interactive mode in **tmap**)?


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ttm()
tm_shape(car_dep_100) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5) +
  tm_view(basemaps = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite)
```

## Homework

- Work through Chapter 12 of Geocomputation with R on Transport - https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html
- Save your workings in an R script

Bonus 1 Complete exercise 1 (not bonus)

Bonus 1 (non technical): answer question 3

Bonus 2 (technical): can you reproduce the results for Leeds? This starting point may be useful:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
region = "west-yorkshire"
b = "https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw"
u = paste0("/master/commute/msoa/", region)
u_od = paste0(b, u, "/od_attributes.csv")
od = readr::read_csv(u_od)
z = sf::read_sf(paste0(b, u, "/z.geojson"))
cents = sf::read_sf(paste0(b, u, "/c.geojson"))
od_clean = od %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  filter(geo_code1 %in% cents$geo_code) %>% 
  filter(geo_code2 %in% cents$geo_code) 

  
desire_lines = stplanr::od2line(flow = od_clean, cents)
tm_shape(desire_lines$geometry[1:99]) %>% 
  tm_lines()
```
