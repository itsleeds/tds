## Pre-requisites

You need to have a number of packages installed and loaded.
Install the packages by typing in the following commands into RStudio (you do not need to add the comments after the `#` symbol):^[
Note: if you want to install the development version of a package from GitHub, you can do so.
Try, for example, running the following command: `remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")`
]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
pkgs = c(
  "nycflights13",# data package
  "pct",         # package for getting travel data in the UK
  "sf",          # spatial data package
  "stats19",     # downloads and formats open stats19 crash data
  "stplanr",     # for working with origin-destination and route data
  "tidyverse",   # a package for user friendly data science
  "tmap"         # for making maps
)
remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
```



## Project set-up and tidyverse testing (30 minutes)

- Check your packages are up-to-date with `update.packages()`
- Create an RStudio project with an appropriate name for this module (e.g. `TDSmodule`)
- Create appropriate files for code, data and anything else (e.g. images)
- Create a script called `learning-tidyverse.R`, e.g. with the following command:

```r
dir.create("code") # 
file.edit("code/learning-tidyverse.R")
```




## Getting started with transport data

This section will use content from the R for Data Science book [@grolemund_data_2016].

- Read [section 5.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter) of R for Data Science and write code that reproduces the results in that section in the script `learning-tidyverse.R`

Your script will start with something like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```


## Reading-in and processing basic data

Read-in the coffee data we created last week, e.g. with:

```{r}
u = paste0(
  "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/",
  "raw/master/sample-data/everyone.csv"
  )
d = read_csv(u)
```

Create a new variable called 'n_coffee_yr' with the following command:

```{r}
d$n_coffee_yr = d$n_coffee * 52
```

Find the mean number of cups of coffee people drink per year (and the total)

Note: the same result can be achieved as follows:

```{r}
d_updated = mutate(d, n_coffee_yr = n_coffee * 52)

# or 
d_updated = d %>% 
  mutate(n_coffee_yr = n_coffee * 52)
```

- Which do you prefer?

- Filter-out only those who travel by bus

- Bonus: Create a new dataset that keeps only the `person_name` and `n_coffee_yr` variables (hint: use the `select()` function)

- Bonus: do those who travel by bus drink more or less coffee than those who do not?

## Processing medium sized data and basic visualisation (30 minutes, individually)

- Take a random sample of 10,000 flights and assign it to an object with the following line of code:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights_sample = sample_n(flights, 1e4)
unique(flights$carrier)
```

- Find the unique carriers with the `unique()` function

- Create an object containing flights from United, American, or Delta, and assign it to `f`, as follows:

```{r}
f = filter(flights, grepl(pattern = "UA|AA|DL", x = carrier))
f2 = filter(flights, grepl(pattern = "UA", x = carrier) |
             grepl(pattern = "AA", x = carrier) |
             grepl(pattern = "DL", x = carrier)
           )
f3 = filter(flights, str_detect(carrier, "UA|AA|DL"))
```

- Create plots that visualise the sample flights, using code from Chapter 3 of the same book, starting with the following plot:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance))
```

- Add transparency so it looks like this (hint: use `alpha =` in the `geom_point()` function call):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance), alpha = 0.1)
```

- Add a colour for each carrier, so it looks something like this:

```{r}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance, colour = carrier), alpha = 0.5)
```

- Bonus 1: find the average air time of those flights with a distance of 1000 to 2000 miles

- Bonus 2: use the `lm()` function to find the relationship between flight distance and time, and plot the results (start the plot as follows, why did we use `na.omit()`? hint - find help with `?na.omit()`):

```{r}
f = na.omit(f)
m = lm(air_time ~ distance, data = f)
f$pred = m$fitted.values
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance, colour = carrier), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(pred, distance))
```

## Homework

1) create a reproducible document 

- Create an Rmarkdown file with the following command:

```r
file.edit("learning-tidyverse.Rmd")
```

- Take a read of the guidance on RMarkdown files online and in the following location (or search online for the 'RMarkdown cheatsheet'):

```
Help > Cheatsheets > RMarkdown
```

- Put the code you generated for `tidyverse.R` into the Rmd file and knit it

- Bonus: create a GitHub repo and publish the results of of your work (hint: putting `output: github_document` may help here!)

2) Work-through the remaining exercises of the first sections in R4DS chapters 3 and 5
  - Write and R script, with comments, to show your working (and prove you've done it!)
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mpg
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(hwy, cyl, col = drv ))
library(nycflights13)
names(flights)
?flights
# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# part 1:
delayed_hour = flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 60)
nrow(delayed_hour) / nrow(flights)
# part 2: calculate length of delay
flight_delays = flights %>% 
  mutate(delay = dep_delay - arr_delay)
summary(flight_delays$delay)

# part 3:
result = flight_delays %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 60 & delay > 30)  
nrow(result)

summary(is.na(flights$arr_delay))

# base R approach
sel_delayed = flights$dep_delay > 60 &
  !is.na(flights$dep_delay)
sel_arrive = flights$arr_delay < 30 &
  !is.na(flights$arr_delay)
class(sel_arrive)
sel_combined = sel_arrive & sel_delayed
sum(sel_combined)
result2 = flights[sel_combined, ]
nrow(result2)
```
  

3) Create an RMarkdown file containing reproducible code outlining what you learned today

4) Identify a dataset you would like to work with for the practical next week.
