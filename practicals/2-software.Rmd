## Project set-up and tidyverse testing (30 minutes, individually)

- Check your packages are up-to-date with `update.packages()`
- Create an RStudio project with an appropriate name for this module (e.g. `TDS`)
- Create appropriate files for code, data and anything else (e.g. images)
- Create a script called `learning-tidyverse.R`, e.g. with **one** the following commands:

```r
file.edit(learning-tidyverse.R) # or
file.edit(code/learning-tidyverse.R)
```


- Read [section 5.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter) of R for Data Science and write code that reproduces the results in that section in the script `learning-tidyverse.R`

Your script will start with something like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Reading-in and processing coffee data

Read-in the coffee data we created last week, e.g. with:

```{r}
u = paste0(
  "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/",
  "raw/master/sample-data/everyone.csv"
  )
d = read_csv(u)
```

Create a new variable called 'n_coffee_yr' with the following command:

```{r}
d$n_coffee_yr = d$n_coffee * 52
```

Find the mean number of cups of coffee people drink per year (and the total)

Note: the same result can be acheived as follows:

```{r}
d = mutate(d, n_coffee_yr = n_coffee * 52)

# or 
d = d %>% 
  mutate(n_coffee_yr = n_coffee * 52)
```

- Which do you prefer?

- Filter-out only those who travel by bus

- Bonus: Create a new dataset that keeps only the `person_name` and `n_coffee_yr` variables (hint: use the `select()` function)

- Bonus: do those who travel by bus drink more or less coffee than those who do not?

## Processing a big file and basic visualisation (30 minutes, individually)

- Take a random sample of 10,000 flights and assign it to an object with the following line of code:

```{r}
flights_sample = sample_n(flights, 1e4)
```

- Find the unique carriers with the `unique()` function

- Create an object containing flights from United, American, or Delta, and assign it to `f`, as follows:

```{r}
f = filter(flights, grepl(pattern = "UA|AA|DL", x = carrier))
```

- Create plots that visualise the sample flights, using code from Chapter 3 of the same book, starting with the following plot:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance))
```

- Add transparency so it looks like this (hint: use `alpha =` in the `geom_point()` function call):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance), alpha = 0.1)
```

- Add a colour for each carrier, so it looks something like this:

```{r}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance, colour = carrier), alpha = 0.5)
```

- Bonus 1: find the average air time of those flights with a distance of 1000 to 2000 miles

- Bonus 2: use the `lm()` function to find the relationship between flight distance and time, and plot the results (start the plot as follows, why did we use `na.omit()`? hint - find help with `?na.omit()`):

```{r}
f = na.omit(f)
m = lm(air_time ~ distance, data = f)
f$pred = m$fitted.values
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance, colour = carrier), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(pred, distance))
```

## Homework

1) create a reproducible document 

- Create an Rmarkdown file with the following command:

```r
file.edit("learning-tidyverse.Rmd")
```

- Take a read of the guidance on RMarkdown files online and in the following location (or search online for the 'RMarkdown cheatsheet'):

```
Help > Cheatsheets > RMarkdown
```

- Put the code you generated for `tidyverse.R` into the Rmd file and knit it

- Bonus: create a GitHub repo and publish the results of of your work (hint: putting `output: github_document` may help here!)

2) Work-through the remaining exercises of the first sections in R4DS chapters 3 and 5
  - Write and R script, with comments, to show your working (and prove you've done it!)

3) Create an RMarkdown file containing reproducible code outlining what you learned today

4) Identify a dataset you would like to work with for the practical next week.
