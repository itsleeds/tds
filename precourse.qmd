## Welcome {-}


This self-assessment questionnaire is designed to help you evaluate your readiness for the **Transport Data Science** (TRAN5340M) module at the University of Leeds. The module focuses on applying data science techniques to solve real-world transport problems using open source software, with a strong emphasis on reproducible workflows.

**Please check one box for each question unless the question explicitly states to "Tick all that apply".**


## Skills assessment


<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 1 points respectively -->


### How comfortable are you with managing files and folders on your computer?


- [ ] Very comfortable (I use file managers like Explorer or Finder to organize deep folder structures and search for files)
- [ ] Comfortable (I can perform operations like creating, moving, and renaming folders/files)
- [ ] Somewhat comfortable (I can do simple tasks but sometimes struggle to find where I saved things)
- [ ] Not very comfortable (I often need help finding files or organizing folders)


<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 1 points respectively -->


### How confident are you with installing software on your computer?


- [ ] Very confident (I can install and configure most software)
- [ ] Confident (I can install standard software)
- [ ] Somewhat confident (I can install basic software but need guidance for complex tools)
- [ ] Not confident (I need help with software installation)


<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 0 points respectively -->


### Have you used a command line interface (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt in Windows, Mac Terminal, Linux shell) before?


- [ ] Yes, regularly (I use it for multiple tasks including file management and installing software)
- [ ] Yes, occasionally (I've used it for simple commands, such as simple one-off calculations, navigating directories or listing files)
- [ ] No, but keen to learn


## Data science skills


<!-- SCORING: 1 point per item ticked, maximum 5 points -->


### What data analysis or data science outputs have you produced?


By data science, we mean using command-line programmes and editing code to work with and modify datasets and to generate results.


*Tick all that apply*


*[Skip the next few questions if you have only followed tutorials]*

- [ ] Professional or academic-grade outputs
- [ ] Data visualization (e.g., map or chart)
- [ ] Clean, processed dataset from raw data
- [ ] Statistical analysis or model (e.g., regression)
- [ ] Interactive dashboard or web application
- [ ] Automated/reproducible report or technical document
- [ ] Only followed step-by-step tutorials so far

<!-- SCORING: 1 point per item ticked, maximum 4 points -->


### Which of the following problems have you solved independently (with or without AI help)?


*Tick all that apply*


- [ ] **Working Directories**: Fixing "File not found" errors by managing relative/absolute paths
- [ ] **Data Types**: Troubleshooting why a plot fails because a column is a 'string' vs 'numeric'
- [ ] **Package Management**: Resolving failed library installations or version conflicts
- [ ] **Vector/List Logic**: Understanding why your code ran but only returned a single value instead of a column
- [ ] **Documentation**: Successfully using StackOverflow, reading GitHub issues, implementing instructions from AI tools such as ChatGPT or documentation to fix a specific error message

<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 points respectively -->


### Do you have experience with R or Python for data science?


- [ ] Yes, extensive (I use them regularly for data analysis)
- [ ] Yes, intermediate (I can write scripts and use common packages)
- [ ] Yes, basic (I've completed an introduction)
- [ ] No, but I'm keen to learn

<!-- SCORING: 1 point per item ticked, maximum 2 points -->


### Which of the following packages (libraries) have you used?


*Tick all that apply*


- [ ] tidyverse or pandas (data manipulation)
- [ ] sf or geopandas (spatial data handling)
- [ ] Other (please specify): ___________________________

<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 0 points respectively -->


### Have you worked with Quarto, R Markdown or Jupyter notebooks?


- [ ] Yes, extensively (I use them for reports and reproducible work)
- [ ] Yes, occasionally (I've created simple documents)
- [ ] No, but I'm familiar with the concept


## Data science and transport


<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 1 points respectively -->


### How would you rate your ability to load and clean datasets, perform basic data transformations, and calculate summary statistics?


- [ ] Advanced (I can handle complex datasets and analysis)
- [ ] Intermediate (I can perform most common data analysis tasks)
- [ ] Basic (I understand the concepts but need practice)
- [ ] Beginner (I'm just starting to learn these skills)

<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 0 points respectively -->


### Have you worked with spatial/geographic data before?


- [ ] Yes, extensively (I work with spatial data regularly)
- [ ] Yes, occasionally (I've used GIS software or spatial packages)
- [ ] No, but I'm interested in learning

<!-- SCORING: 1 point per item ticked, maximum 4 points -->


### Are you familiar with any of these transport data sources?


*Tick all that apply*


- [ ] OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- [ ] UK road safety data (Stats19)
- [ ] Census travel to work data
- [ ] Origin-destination (OD) matrices


<!-- SCORING: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 points respectively -->


### Experience with version control and code sharing?


- [ ] Yes, I have used Git for version control
- [ ] Yes, I use cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox/OneDrive) to share code
- [ ] No, but I'm keen to learn


<!-- TODO: Revisit whether this section should be a separate questionnaire for data collection.

## Your background

(Information only)

Please share a bit about your background and the tools you use. Which IDE do you primarily use for coding (e.g., RStudio, VS Code)? Have you used AI assistants like Copilot or ChatGPT? We are also interested in your primary motivation for taking this module, your preferred learning style, how much time you can dedicate each week, and your current computer setup. 

In terms of software, let us know what you already have installed and configured, such as R/RStudio, Python, Git, or Docker.
-->


## Next steps


After completing the questionnaire, use the following guide to assess your readiness and prepare for the module.

<!-- 
### Scoring instructions

For each question, assign points based on your answer:

- **Very comfortable/Extensive/Advanced**: 4 points
- **Comfortable/Intermediate**: 3 points  
- **Somewhat comfortable/Basic**: 2 points
- **Not very comfortable/Beginner**: 1 point
- **None of the above/No prior knowledge**: 0 points

### Score interpretation


If you scored 0-15 points, you are at the Beginner level with limited data science experience. Unless you are willing to invest substantial extra time learning basic data science skills, you are likely to struggle.


A score of **16-39 points** indicates an **Intermediate** level, meaning you have basic programming and analysis skills but should review prerequisite materials.


Those scoring **40+ points** are **Experienced with data science tools**, well-prepared for advanced topics and ready to support their peers. -->
