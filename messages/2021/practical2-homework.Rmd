Hi all,

Following the practical session yesterday I have some homework and links and for you.

## 1) Think of topics/datasets that you would like to work on/with for the coursework report that you will submit in May.
Below are some options:

### Topics

- Data collection and analysis
  - Analysis of a large transport dataset, e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201889

- Infrastructure and travel behaviour
  - What are the relationships between specific types of infrastructure and travel, e.g. between fast roads and walking?
  - How do official sources of infrastructure data (e.g. the [CID](https://github.com/PublicHealthDataGeek/CycleInfraLnd/)) compare with crowd-sourced datasets such as OpenStreetMap (which can be accessed with the new [`osmextract` R package](https://github.com/ropensci/osmextract))
  - Machine learning and image recognition to understand transport infrastructure - see https://telraam.net/ for example 

- Changing transport systems
  - Modelling change in transport systems, e.g. by comparing before/after data for different countries/cities, which countries had the hardest lockdowns and where have changes been longer term? - see here for open data: https://github.com/ActiveConclusion/COVID19_mobility
  - How have movement patterns changed during the Coronavirus pandemic and what impact is that likely to have long term (see [here](https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/articles/report3.html) for some graphics on this)
  
- Software development
  - Creating a package to make a particular data source more accessible, see https://github.com/ropensci/stats19 for an example
  - Integration between R and A/B Street - see https://github.com/a-b-street/abstr
  
- Road safety - how can we makes roads and transport systems in general safer?
  
- Other
  - Other topics are welcome
  
### Datasets 

These do not need to be used in isolation but choosing a main dataset should help

- STATS19 road crash data (other countries have other datasets)
- 'PCT' data from UK travel behaviour
- OpenStreetMap data (global, you will need to think of a subset by area/type)
- Open data from a single city, e.g. Seattle: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/
- See here: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#transportation
- And here: https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/awesome-transit

### Start work on 1 page document outlining your ideas

I have set a deadline of Friday 26th February for you to submit a 1-2 page pdf document and .Rmd file.
This does not need to be the final dissertation topic but will give you a chance to get feedback.
The document should contain:

- Topics considered
- Datasets available
- Missing elements/skills/risks
- Questions that will help decide the direction of the final coursework
  - E.g. do you know of a package that can help with this?
  - Is using this dataset a good idea?
  
<!-- Peer-to-peer feedback will help you develop your ideas. -->

## 2) Working with RMarkdown

Take a look at the info + video on RMarkdown here (they describe the benefits of the format better than me!): https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html

Try to reproduce the .Rmd file I have provided - download this and try to knit it and reproduce the example data analysis: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/raw/master/coursework-template.Rmd

## 3) Reading-up on R + Git 

If you would like to learn more about geographic data in R, I suggest taking a look at the first 5 chapters of Geocomputation with R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/

If you feel you need practice on R basics, revisit this workbook and start at the beginning - it should answer many questions: https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/

If you like learning from Videos, I recommend checking out the links + video by Tom Mock here: https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/

If you're interested in what's coming next week, check this video: https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet#ab-street

And for everyone wanting more info on using Git/GitHub I highly recommend watching this video: https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/happy-git-and-gihub-for-the-user-tutorial/

See here for a good introduction: https://happygitwithr.com/

## 4) Install key packages, download data and watch the 'Routing' video by Malcolm

Following feedback from students it seems it would be useful to get a list of all packages used in the TDS module. 
I have separated these between 'core' and 'extra' packages - you will need the core packages for sure and should already have them installed.

### Core packages

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# find deps in project
deps = renv::dependencies()
names(deps)
unique(deps$Package)
```


Run the following commands to check you have them:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
pkgs = c(
  "pct",         # package for getting travel data in the UK
  "sf",          # spatial data package
  "stats19",     # downloads and formats open stats19 crash data
  "stplanr",     # for working with origin-destination and route data
  "tidyverse",   # a package for user friendly data science
  "tmap",        # for making maps
  "opentripplanner", # routing
  "mapview",      # mapping
  "osmextract",  # get osm data
  "dodgr",
  "nycflights13"
)
remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
```

Don't forget, every time you open a new R session you need to load the packages you are going to use, for example:

``` r
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(pct)
```

### Extra packages

These extra packages may be useful.  These are 'development versions' of packages.  This means the packages are in the process of being development (for example, a new version of an existing package).  These development versions are hosted on github rather than CRAN.  CRAN stands for 'The Comprehensive R Archive Network'.  It is an online repository for packages where they go through regular testing https://cran.r-project.org/ .  

``` r
# CRAN versions
install.packages("spData")

# development versions
remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")
remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/od")
remotes::install_github("a-b-street/abstr")
```

### Automated script

You can check your set-up with this script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("https://git.io/JvGjF")
```


### Download data

Follow instructions here to download the A/B Street data for the seminar:
