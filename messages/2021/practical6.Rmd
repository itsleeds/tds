# Session plan for Practical 6

Like the previous practical session, the aim of this informal session is to support you on the project submission on May 14th.

You will have the opportunity to ask specific questions about the coursework in breakout rooms.

During the first part of the project you will be asked to provide a 2 minute update on your coursework, data you are using and any challenges/questions.

The rooms will be:

- Me in the main room
- Caroline in Room 1
- Martyna in Room 2

I recommend preparing questions before the practical session.
