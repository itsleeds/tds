title: "Transport Data Science"
---

A module teaching how to use data science to solve transport problems.

# R or Python?

A common question that arises when starting new digital projects is 'which language should I use?'. 

The answer for most people taking this course will be R, because it is the language we will be teaching in, and the language in which the module team has the most experience.

You can use Python, and we are working on Python examples, but the support for Python should be considered experimental.

If you do choose to use Python, you will be expected to manage your own Python environment, and to be able to translate the R code examples into Python.

If you are feeling very adventurous, you could try using Julia or another language, but you will be on your own in terms of support.

# Prerequisites

## General computing prerequisites

You should have the latest stable release of R (4.3.0 or above) and be comfortable with computing in general, for example creating folders, moving files, and installing software.

We recommend installing this software on a computer with decent resources (e.g. a laptop with 8 GB of RAM).

## Data science experience prerequisites

Prior experience of using R or Python (e.g. having used it for work, in previous degrees or having completed an online course) is essential.

Students can demonstrate this by showing evidence that they have worked with R before, have completed an online course such as the first 4 sessions in the [RStudio Primers series](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) or [DataCamp’s Free Introduction to R course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).

Evidence of substantial programming and data science experience in previous professional or academic work, in languages such as R or Python, also constitutes sufficient pre-requisite knowledge for the course.

## Software

Although you are free to use any software for the course, the emphasis on reproducibility means that popular popular and established data science languages R and Python are *highly* recommended.

The teaching will be delivered primarily in R, with some Python code snippets and examples.
Unless you have a good reason to use Python, we recommend you use R for the course.

### R software prerequisites

For this module you therefore need to have up-to-date versions of R and RStudio installed on a computer you have access to:

- R from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- RStudio from [rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (recommended) or VS Code with the R extension installed.
- R packages, which can be installed by opening RStudio and typing `install.packages("stats19")` in the R console, for example.
- To install all the dependencies for the module, run the following command in the R console:

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("itsleeds/tds")
```

See [Section 1.5 of the online guide Reproducible Road Safety Research with R](https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/introduction.html#installing-r-and-rstudio) for instructions on how to install key packages we will use in the module.^[
For further guidance on setting-up your computer to run R and RStudio for spatial data, see these links, we recommend 
Chapter 2 of Geocomputation with R (the Prerequisites section contains links for installing spatial software on Mac, Linux and Windows): https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html and Chapter 2 of the online book *Efficient R Programming*, particularly sections 2.3 and 2.5, for details on R installation and [set-up](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html) and the 
[project management section](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#project-management).

### Python software prerequisites

We installing Python with a modern package manager such as `pixi`.
