## Welcome

Welcome to the **Transport Data Science** module.

**Module Leader:** Robin Lovelace

**Description:**
This module focuses on applying data science techniques to solve real-world transport problems. It aims to equip you with up-to-date and future-proof skills through practical examples and reproducible workflows using industry-standard data science tools.

**Teaching Delivery:**
Topics will be delivered in a series of weekly sessions, combining lectures and practical seminars where we will apply the knowledge delivered in the lectures.
Material for lectures will be posted on Minerva and/or this website, usually 48 hours before the lectures.

## How to Give Module Feedback

Feedback is important to ensure your module can be improved and developed to provide the best learning experience possible.

You can give feedback about your module to your course reps to raise at the Student Staff Partnership Forum. If you are unsure who your course rep is, email academicsupport@luu.leeds.ac.uk.

You can speak to your module leader, seminar tutors, or personal tutor.

Your module leader might ask for mid-module feedback, and you'll be asked to complete a module evaluation survey towards the end of the module.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Module Leader. We encourage you to raise issues with the module leader as soon as they arise so that they can be dealt with in a timely manner.

We also welcome your module evaluation at the end of the module. All students at Leeds have the opportunity to offer feedback on their modules. Feedback is important to us and it helps us to make improvements, to understand the student experience, and to see what is already working well.

Your feedback will be used by your module leaders, and sometimes also your seminar tutor or programme leader, to reflect on the delivery of the module and to make improvements.

### Explorance Blue

Explorance Blue is the University of Leeds’ system for processing module evaluations. This section explains how Explorance Blue works in practice.

When your module evaluation goes live, you will receive an email inviting you to log into the system. This link will be unique to you, so please do not share it.

Module evaluations go live towards the end of a semester. When you have evaluations to complete you will be directed via an individualised link to a page with your open evaluations listed on it. The list of modules they have been asked to evaluate will appear under ‘Tasks’.

### Student View

For further information, please refer to Student Education Service's "HOW TO" guide on Explorance Blue.

You can also provide feedback through your student reps who can take this information to the regular Staff Student Partnership Forums.
