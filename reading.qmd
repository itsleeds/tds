This reading list contains key resources for the Transport Data Science module, organized by topic.

# Core Reading

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@wickham_data_2023]
  - This is an excellent and very popular applied introduction to data science with R, covering the Tidyverse and data visualization. It is open access and based on open code, check out the source code at [github.com/hadley/r4ds](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) for insights into how they use Quarto and embed code in their book.
- [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/) [@lovelace_geocomputation_2025]
  - A comprehensive guide to geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling using R. Essential for understanding spatial aspects of transport data.

# Software and Tools

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) [@allaire_quarto_2024]
  - The software used to create this document, Quarto is a powerful tool for creating reproducible documents with code and data.
  - See the [technical writing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html) page of Quarto's documentation for key information on how to add references, figure captions, and more.
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) [@heis_introduction_2025]
  - A good starting point for learning how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
