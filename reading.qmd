# Core Reading

## R Programming and Data Science

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@wickham_data_2023]
  - This is an excellent and very popular applied introduction to data science with R, covering the Tidyverse and data visualization. It is open access and based on open code, check out the source code at [github.com/hadley/r4ds](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) for insights into how they use Quarto and embed code in their book.
- Geocomputation with R [@lovelace_geocomputation_2025]


## Python for Transport Data Science

- [GeoPandas User Guide](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started.html) - For spatial data handling in Python
- [Scientific Python Lectures](https://python-course.eu/python-tutorial/) - Core Python programming concepts
