## Tidyverse

This was **how** I set-up my project:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
names(flights)
# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# part 1:
delayed_hour = flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 60)
nrow(delayed_hour) / nrow(flights)
```
