title: "Assessment Overview: Transport Data Science (TRAN5340M)"
---

## Objectives

This module's assessments are designed to help you:

1. Develop practical data science skills for solving real-world transport problems
2. Apply programming and analysis techniques to transport datasets
3. Generate insights from transport data that can inform policy and planning decisions
4. Demonstrate reproducible research practices in transport studies

## Module Assessment Structure

The module is assessed through two coursework assignments:

1. **Formative Assessment (CW1)** 
   - Required but non-assessed (0% of final mark)
   - Due: 28th February 2025, 13:59
   - Project plan and reproducible code demonstration
   - Length: 2 pages recommended (5 pages maximum)

2. **Summative Assessment (CW2)**
   - Worth 100% of module mark
   - Due: 16th May 2025, 14:00
   - Complete data science project report
   - Length: 10 pages maximum + appendices

## File Naming Convention

You must name your files using the following format:
```
TRAN5340M_StudentIDNumber.file_type
```

For example:
- `TRAN5340M_201234567.zip`

## Submission Format Requirements

### Document Formatting

- Include student ID in the title page
- Do not include your name (for anonymous marking)
- Use the default Quarto referencing style

### File Requirements

**Formative Assessment Package:**
