title: "Assessment Overview: Transport Data Science (TRAN5340M)"
---

## Objectives

This module's assessments are designed to help you:

1. Develop practical data science skills for solving real-world transport problems
2. Apply programming and analysis techniques to transport datasets
3. Generate insights from transport data that can inform policy and planning decisions
4. Demonstrate reproducible research practices in transport studies

## Module Assessment Structure

The module is assessed through two coursework assignments:

1. **Assessment 1: Code Submission & Presentation (30% of module mark)**
   - **Format:** Code submission + Oral Presentation
   - **Deadline:** 27th February 2026, 13:59 (Code), Presentation scheduled separately
   - **Components:**
     - Idea and concept
     - Code implementation and data visualization
     - Oral communication and answering questions

2. **Assessment 2: Data Science Project Report (70% of module mark)**
   - **Format:** Complete data science project report
   - **Deadline:** 15th May 2026, 14:00
   - **Length:** 10 pages maximum + appendices

## File Naming Convention

You must name your files using the following format:
```
TRAN5340M_StudentIDNumber.file_type
```

For example:
- `TRAN5340M_201234567.zip`

## Submission Format Requirements

### Assessment 1 (Presentation & Code)
